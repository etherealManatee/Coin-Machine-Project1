# AvoidTheThings - Coin Machine
First project to apply HTML, CSS and DOM manipulation with Javascript.
A simple game using the mouse cursor to play.

#Technical Used
- HTML
- CSS with SASS
- Javascript

#User Story
User must be able to:
- read the instructions
- start the game
- move the cursor and avoid the dropping coins
- be notified when they hit a coin and a life is lost
- be notified when they hit a bonus coin and gain extra points
- gain points when the coins reach the bottom

#Planning and Development Process
###Problem Solving Strategy
1) initially wanted to create a hitbox around the cursor, but was unable to do so with the limited amount of time. After some research and reading I decided to use the event listener for mouse enter.


###Unsolved Problems
1) Music on and off button not working
2) Coins still continue to drop in the background after player has lost all lives
3) A refresh of the page is required for the coins to fall properly again
